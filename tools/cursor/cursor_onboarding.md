# Quickstart

This quickstart will walk you through a project using Cursor's core features. By the end, you'll be familiar with Tab, Inline Edit, and Agent.

[Download Cursor⤓](https://cursor.com/downloads)

If you are new to Cursor, please download the free version that includes the Pro free trial. Once your trial ends, upgrade to Cursor Pro and we will reimburse you for the cost.

## Open a project in Cursor

Open Cursor, then open a project folder with `Cmd O` or `cursor <path-to-project>`.

## Autocomplete with Tab

[Tab](/docs/configuration/kbd#tab) is the autocomplete model we've trained in-house. It's a great way to ease into AI assisted coding if you're not used to it. With Tab, you can:

- Autocomplete **multiple lines and blocks** of code
- Jump **in** and **across** files to the next autocomplete suggestion

Let's try it out:

1. Start typing the beginning of a function: `function calculate`
2. Tab suggestions appear automatically
3. Press Tab to accept the suggestion
4. Cursor suggests parameters and function bodies

## Inline Edit a selection

1. Select the function you just created
2. Press Cmd K
3. Type "make this function calculate fibonacci numbers"
4. Press Return to apply the changes
5. Cursor adds imports and documentation

## Chat with Agent

1. Open the Chat panel (Cmd I)
2. Ask: "Add tests for this function and run them"
3. [Agent](/docs/agent/overview) will create a test file, write test cases, and run them for you

## Feature Walkthrough

This tutorial demonstrates ten pro tips, including plan mode for codebase-aware feature implementation and custom command creation via markdown files. Learn how to integrate these tools effectively into your development workflow.
